# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ali Al Kadhim

### Physics Ph.D. Candidate (Florida State University) | CERN CMS Member & AI/ML Researcher | Data Science & Scientific Computing Enthusiast

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [BayesOptPythia](https://github.com/AliAlkadhim/BayesOptPythia) which is the repository for the paper *Bayesian Optimization of Pythia8 Tunes* (which can be accessed here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11675). In this paper, we use Bayesian Optimization to tune the most important parameters for the most important monte carlo generator in particle physics.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and NoSQL databases, data pipeline and workflow management tools, data wearhouse design, MLOps platforms.
